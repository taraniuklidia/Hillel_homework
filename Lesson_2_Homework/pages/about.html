 <center><p><b>EARLY YEARS</b></p></center>
 <center><span>Alphonse Maria Mucha was born in the town of Ivancice, Moravia (today's region of Czech Republic). <br> His singing abilities allowed him to continue his education through high school in the Moravian capital of Brünn (today Brno),<br> even though drawing had been his first love since childhood.  He worked at decorative painting jobs in Moravia, mostly painting theatrical scenery, <br> then in 1879 moved to Vienna to work for a leading Viennese theatrical design company,while informally furthering his artistic education. <br> When a fire destroyed his employer's business in 1881 he returned to Moravia, doing freelance decorative and portrait painting. <br> Count Karl Khuen of Mikulov hired Mucha to decorate Hrusovany Emmahof Castle with murals, <br> and was impressed enough that he agreed to sponsor Mucha's formal training at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts.</span></center>

            <p>Mucha married Maruska (Marie/Maria) Chytilová on June 10, 1906, in Prague. The couple visited the U.S. from 1906 to 1910, when their daughter, Jaroslava, was born in New York City.They also had a son, Jiri, born on March 12, 1915 in Prague - April 5, 1991 in Prague)  who later became a well known journalist, writer, screenwriter, author of autobiographical novels and studies of the works of his father.  There he expected to earn money to fund his nationalistic projects to demonstrate to Czechs that he had not "sold out". He was supported by millionaire Charles R. Crane, who applied his fortune to promote revolutions, and after meeting Thomas Masaryk, Slavic nationalism. The family then returned to the Czech lands and settled in Prague,  where he decorated the Theater of Fine Arts, contributed the murals in the Mayor's Office at the Municipal House, and other landmarks of the city. When Czechoslovakia won its independence after World War I, Mucha designed the new postage stamps, banknotes, and other government documents for the new state.</p>

<center><p><b>LEGACY</b></p></center>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><p>By the time of his death, Mucha's style was considered outdated. However, his son, author Jiri Mucha, devoted much of his life to writing about him and bringing attention to his art. Interest in Mucha's distinctive style experienced a strong revival in the 1960s (with a general interest in Art Nouveau) and is particularly evident in the psychedelic posters of Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, the collective name for two British artists, Michael English and Nigel Waymouth, who designed posters for groups such as Pink Floyd and The Incredible String Band.In his own country, the new authorities were not interested in Mucha. His Slav Epic was rolled and stored for twenty-five years before being shown in Moravsky Krumlov and only recently has a Mucha museum appeared in Prague, run by his grandson, John Mucha.
<br>
            <br>It has continued to experience periodic revivals of interest for illustrators and artists. It is a strong acknowledged influence for Stuckist painter Paul Harvey whose subjects have included Madonna and whose work was used to promote The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Walker Art Gallery during the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. the japanese manga artist Naoko Takeuchi released a series of official posters depicting five of the main characters from her manga series Sailor Moon mimicking Mucha's style. Another manga artist, the 1962 born Masakazu Katsura has also mimicked Mucha's style several times. Comic book artist and current Marvel Comics Editor in Chief Joe Quesada also borrowed heavily from Mucha's techniques for a series of covers, posters, and prints. Grindcore and sludge metal band Soilent Green used a picture by Mucha for the cover of their album Sewn Mouth Secrets.
            <br>
            <br>One of Mucha's paintings, Quo Vadis or alternately Petronius and Eunice, was the subject of a legal dispute in 1986. The judgment handed down by Richard Posner describes parts of Mucha's life and work biographically.
            <br>
            <br>Among his many other accomplishments, Mucha was also the founder of Czech Freemasonry. (From Wikipedia)

<center><p><b>HIS WORKS</b></p></center>
<center><p>Mucha produced a flurry of paintings, posters, advertisements, and book illustrations, as well as designs for jewellery, carpets, wallpaper, and theatre sets in what was initially called the Mucha Style but became known as Art Nouveau (French for 'new art'). Mucha's works frequently featured beautiful healthy young women in flowing vaguely Neoclassical looking robes, often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed haloes behind the women's heads. In contrast with contemporary poster makers he used paler pastel colors. </p></center>
